# Collapse

The collapse JavaScript plugin is used to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements you toggle. Collapsing an element will animate the height from its current value to 0. Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use padding on a .collapse element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.

- `.collapse` hides content
- `.collapsing` is applied during transitions
- `.collapse.show` shows content
