# Navbar

- Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with `.navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}` for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
- The animation effect of this component is dependent on the prefers-reduced-motion media query.
- `.navbar-brand` for your company, product, or project name.
- `.navbar-nav` for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).
- `.navbar-toggler` for use with our collapse plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors.
- `.form-inline` for any form controls and actions.
- `.navbar-text` for adding vertically centered strings of text.
- `.collapse.navbar-collapse` for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.
