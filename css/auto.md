# Auto

The margin property also lets you center content. The `0` sets the top and bottom margins to `0` pixels. The `auto` value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element. In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element.

```css
div.headline {
  width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
