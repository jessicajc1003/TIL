# Dots Per Inch (DPI)

Many times we will want to supply higher quality media (images, video, etc.) only to users with screens that can support high resolution media. Targeting screen resolution also helps users avoid downloading high resolution (large file size) images that their screen may not be able to properly display.

```css
@media only screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
  /* CSS for high resolution screens */
}
```
