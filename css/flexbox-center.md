# When you want to declare the element to the middle of the screen using flexbox in the body section

```
body {
    height: 100vh; //100% of the viewport height
    display: flex // items are directed as a row
    flex-direction: colum //items are directed as a colum
    justify-content: center // item containers are located at the center of the screen width
    align-items: center // items are centered (keeping the original item size)
}
```
