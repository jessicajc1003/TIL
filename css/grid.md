# grid

- three major components: columns, gutters, and margins
  - column: the vertical sections that span the width of a page (12-16 columns)
  - gutter: the negative space between each column ensuring the columns don’t run together
  - margin: appear on the left and right sides of the column-based grid to ensure the content of your designs doesn’t match up to the edges of the browser window
