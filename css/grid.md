# grid

- three major components: columns, gutters, and margins
  - column: the vertical sections that span the width of a page (12-16 columns)
  - gutter: the negative space between each column ensuring the columns don’t run together
  - margin: appear on the left and right sides of the column-based grid to ensure the content of your designs doesn’t match up to the edges of the browser window
    <br>
- `grid-template-columns` defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
- `grid-template-rows` defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
- `grid-template` is a shorthand for defining both `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` in one line
- `grid-gap` puts blank space between rows and/or columns of the grid
- `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` makes elements span certain rows of the grid
- `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` makes elements span certain columns of the grid
- `grid-area` is a shorthand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end`, all in one line
