# Linking

`<link>` element

```css
<link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
```

- to link HTML and CSS files together
- placed within the head of the HTML file

1. `href` — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
2. `type` — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
3. `rel` — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
