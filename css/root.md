# Root

```
:root {
  /* color */
  --color-black: #3f454d;
  --color-white: #ffffff;
  --color-blue: #3b88c3;
  --color-yellow: #fbbe28;
  --color-pink: #fd7f84;
  --color-light-grey: #dfdfdf;
}

```

Advantages:

- You don't have to go one by one in every single code
- You can just fix fromn there if there is any change later on
