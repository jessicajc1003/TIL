# CSS Selector Specificity
- When a style declaration is found to be in conflict with a previously declared style, there is a method for determining which one will win out. The process is built into every web browser, and almost all of them calculate the values identically (for once!).
- more specific selectors will override more general ones
- Make three tallies for each each occurrence of:

    I - `#`id selectors

    C - `.`class, `:`pseudoclass, `[]`attribute selectors

    E - HTML element selectors
