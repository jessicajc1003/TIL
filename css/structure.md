# CSS Structure

- **CSS value definition syntax**, a formal grammar, is used for defining the set of valid values for a CSS property or function. The definition **syntax** describes which values are allowed and the interactions between them.
- CSS **declarations**: a property and value pair
- The **property** which is an identifier, that is a human-readable *name*, that defines which feature is considered.
- The **value** which describe how the feature must be handled by the engine. Each property has a set of valid values, defined by a formal grammar, as well as a semantic meaning, implemented by the browser engine.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

- `h1`: selector
- `{color: blue}`: declaration
- `color`: Property - the property you’d like to style of that element (i.e., size, color, etc.).
- `blue`: Value - the value of the property (i.e., 18px for size, blue for color, etc.).
