# Branch

Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.

## Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site

1. Create a branch: `gh-page`
2. Commit to `gh-page`
3. Go to your github
4. Type "user-id.github.io/repository-name"

_Make sure the current branch is back to `master` when making changes in the original file after creating a branch in the Github Desktop_
