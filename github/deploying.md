# Deploying

- Refers to Publishing 
- Deployment is when a project is packaged and shared on the Internet. Unlike publishing

## Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site using Github Desktop App

0. Click New branch
1. Create a branch: `gh-pages`
2. Click Publish branch `gh-pages`
3. Go to your github
4. navigating in your browser to the URL `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<project-name>`

**Make sure the current branch is back to `master` when making changes in the original file after creating a branch in the Github Desktop**
=> This will allow you to ensure all of your sites are deployed automatically whenever you push to GitHub

## Deploying New Changes
Now that your GitHub Pages site is set up, deploying new changes is easy. Every time you make a change to your site, use the normal GitHub flow. That is, use git commit and git push to send your changes to GitHub. After this, the GitHub site should update within a few seconds. Just refresh the page in your browser, then you will see the changed web page!
