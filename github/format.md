# Basic writing and formatting syntax
Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
* ***Make sure to add extension (eg .md) at the end of the file name***

## Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
```
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```
## Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.

| Style | Syntax | Keyboard shortcut | Example	Output |

| Bold | ** ** or __ __ command/control + b | **This is bold text** | This is bold text |
| Italic | * * or _ _	command/control + i | *This text is italicized* | This text is italicized |
