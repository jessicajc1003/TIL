# How to add images to README.md

way to do this without hosting the images on any third-party web hosting services:

1. Upload the screenshot to Github
2. Click the file, then you will see the link of a raw image.
3. Copy the link `![alt text](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)` and past it to your `README.md`

OR

1. Click 'issues' in Github repo
2. Drag and drop the photo
3. Wait for a bit
4. Copy and past the link to `README.md`

**There is no way to change the size of an image if the markdown format is of the form []() - so stop looking right now! - you must use `<img>` instead**
