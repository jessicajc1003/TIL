# `<br>` Line Break Element

The `<br>` line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is required, like in a postal address. The line break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing tag.

A line break haiku.<br />
Poems are a great use case.<br />
Oh joy! A line break.
```
