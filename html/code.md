# code 

The `<code>` tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Tip: This tag is not deprecated. However, it is possible to achieve richer effect by using CSS (see example below).

## Styling the Code Block
In order to display the code properly and in an easy to read fashion, we need to style the <code> block. This page uses the following CSS styles to display the code block:
pre code {
  background-color: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #999;
  display: block;
  padding: 20px;
}
