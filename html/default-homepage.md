# Default Homepage

The `index.html` page is the most common name used for the default page shown on a website if no other page is specified when a visitor requests the site.

- Is that okay to have multiple `index.html` files when I have various projects? every single websites will say `index.html` !! It means a homepage. You will get better result from server by naming it in that way.
