# description

## The `img` Element Attributes
`alt`: Don't write "an image of..." because it's obvious. just *describe* correctly what kind of the image is.

## CTA (Call To Action)
Don't do just write "Click me". Always describe the anchor tag!!!!  ← Context sensitive anchor tag, nothing abstract or obscure.
