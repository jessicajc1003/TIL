# `<!DOCTYPE html>`

The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.

A lot of IDEs allow users to leave this out and default to a certain HTML style, but leaving it out does pose a potential threat in browser compatibility and the use of older versions of HTML.

For example: new features & tags in HTML5 such as `<article>,<footer>, <header>, <nav>, <section>` may not be supported if the `<!DOCTYPE>` is not declared.
