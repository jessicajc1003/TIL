# Form

- To add fields for users to input information we use the `input` element and set the `type` attribute to a field of our choosing:
  - Setting `type` to `number` creates a single row field for number input.
  - Setting `type` to `range` creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
  - Setting `type` to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
- A `select` element is populated with `option` elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
- A `datalist` element is populated with `option` elements and works with an `input` to search through choices.
- Adding the `required` attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.
  - `min`, `max`, `minlength`, `maxlength`
- Assigning a regex(=regular expression) to `pattern` matches the input to the provided regex.
