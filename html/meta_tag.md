# Meta tags

Meta means extra (information).

```
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

- `charset` means character encoding

- `meta charset` tag helps to set what kind of character(language) you are writing and to let the browser know what kind of character of the website. Otherwise, it will appear as `???` (=error).
