# if, else and or

if-else: a condition

eg. if the user clicks here, do this. Else, do that.

```jsx
if (condition) {
  block;
} else {
  block;
}
```

- block examples: console.log, alert.log etc
- if condition has to be true always

`===` : I am not assigning anything, just checking `

`&&` : and

`||` : or

`>=` equals and or smaller (A ≥ B)

`<=` equals and or bigger (A ≤ B)
