# Differences between library and framework

## Library:

- "I" am calling the libraries.
- We use library when we need it.
- Library can be replaced easily.
- example: JQuery

## Framework:

- "Framework" calls your work.
- You have to follow the rules in the framework.
- Framework gives you the rules and the structures.
- example: django

### React js

- It can be a library and framework because:
  - you call it when you need it
  - react js calls our components interactive
