# Differences between `null` and `undefined`

## null

```jsx
let nothing = null;
console.log(`value: ${nothing}, type: ${type of nothing}`);

```

The value is obiviously empty.

## undefined

```jsx
let x;
console.log(`value: ${x}, type: ${typeof x}`);
```

The value is declared, yet we don't know if it is empty or not.
