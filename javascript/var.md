## let, const, var

`const` = constant(means stable)

- when you do not want to change the value
- immutable data type

`let`

- when you want to change the value as many times as you want
- mutable date type

`var` = variable

- you can modify `var` just like using `let`
- DO NOT USE THIS due to initializing errors
  - **`var` hoisting: move declaration from bottom to top**
