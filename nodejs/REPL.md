# REPL

**Read–Eval–Print Loop**

This functionality allows you execute JavaScript commands from the command line.

With Node installed, you can launch the REPL by running the node command in a terminal and pressing Enter/Return. You are now in an interactive JavaScript environment and can run any valid JavaScript code such as 4 + 5. After executing a command, Node will always print the result of that evaluation.

```bash
$ node
> 4 + 5
9
> function nodeIsGreat() {
... console.log('Node is great!');
... }
undefined
> nodeIsGreat()
Node is great!
undefined
```

* To exit the REPL: `ctrl + D`
