# global

1. Type `node` in the terminal and press `enter`.
2. If you need all useful properties and methods, simply type `global`
3. Read list of the properties on the global object with `object.key(global)`
4. If it is just an object, add a property to the global object, eg. `global.cat = 'meow!'`.

**The `Window` object is the JavaScript object in the browser that holds the DOM, since we don’t have a DOM here, there’s no Window object.**
