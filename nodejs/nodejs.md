# Node.js
a JavaScript runtime for building server-side or desktop applications

## Why Node?
Node is built well to handle asynchronous JavaScript code to perform many asynchronous activities such as reading and writing to the file system, handling connections to database servers, or handling requests as a web server.

To handle asynchronous code, Node uses a callback-based system.

## How to use Node?
```bash
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v14.15.1.
Type ".help" for more information. // Node is installed 
$ cd Desktop
$ ls
hello.js
$ node hello.js
5

```
