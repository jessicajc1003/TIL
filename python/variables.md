# variables

In Python, we assign variables by using the equals sign `(=)`.

Variables can’t have spaces or symbols in their names other than an underscore (_). They can’t begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter (e.g., cool_variable_5 is OK).

```py
message_string = "Hello there"
# Prints "Hello there"
print(message_string)
```

### Variables - Facts

- Variable are volatile, they exist in the memory just while the program is running. They are erased when the program ends.
- We store **Values** in variables. For example, the following assignments push values in the variable `Age = 20`
- We can change the value stored in a variable during the execution of the program.
- In most of programming languages, a variable needs to be declared before being used by specifying the name and the data type.
- Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. The datatype is assigned dynamically, based on the value.
- The best practice for naming variables in Python is `snake_case`. This is all lower case with underscores separating the words.
