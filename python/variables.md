# variables

In Python, we assign variables by using the equals sign `(=)`.

Variables can’t have spaces or symbols in their names other than an underscore (_). They can’t begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter (e.g., cool_variable_5 is OK).

```py
message_string = "Hello there"
# Prints "Hello there"
print(message_string)
```
