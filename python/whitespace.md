# whitespace 

In Python, the amount of whitespace tells the computer what is part of a function and what is not part of that function. 
```py
def about_this_computer():
  print("This computer is running on version Everest Puma")
print("This is your desktop")

about_this_computer()

#This is your desktop
#This computer is running on version Everest Puma
```
