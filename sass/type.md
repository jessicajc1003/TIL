# Sass(y) Types

- There are different data types you can assign to a variable in CSS.

  - `Color` data type

  - `Numbers` (eg., 8.11, 12, and 10px ) Notice that while 10 has a unit of px associated with it, it is still considered a number.

  - `Strings` of text, with and without quotes. Eg., "potato", 'tomato', span

  - `Booleans`: true and false.

  - `null`: an empty value.

- Sass also has two other data types:

  - `Lists` can be separated by either spaces or commas

  ```sass
  Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif

  // or

  10px 15px 0 0
  ```

- `Maps` hold pairs of keys and values, and make it easy to look up a value by its corresponding key

```sass
(key1: value1, key2: value2);
```
