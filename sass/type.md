# Sass(y) Types

- There are different data types you can assign to a variable in CSS.

  - `Color` data type

  - `Numbers` (eg., 8.11, 12, and 10px ) Notice that while 10 has a unit of px associated with it, it is still considered a number.

  - `Strings` of text, with and without quotes. Eg., "potato", 'tomato', span

  - `Booleans`: true and false.

  - `null`: an empty value.
