# Color Schemes

- Monochromatic: all the colors of a single hue
- Complementary: opposite color
- Analogous: groups of three colours that are next to each other on the colour wheel
- Triadic: virant colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel

## Accessibility:

many users can experience different types of color blindness:

- red-green: where users have a difficult time differentiating between the red and green colors.
- blue-yellow: where the blues tend to appear greener
- monochromatic: when users canâ€™t see color at all.
