# Prototype

a middle to high-fidelity representation of the final product, which simulates user interface interaction

Two types of prototype:

- low-fidelity[LOW-FI]:

  - a conceptualization using pen and paper or post-its
  - real-time iteration: you can quickly redo part of the design based on customer comments in real time

- High-fidelity[HIGH-FI]:
  - a fully functional product
  - pinpoint specific components to test
  - more presentable to stakeholders
