# Wireframe

a low-fidelity design layout that serves three simple but exact purposes:

- It presents the information that will be displayed on the page
- It gives an outline of structure and layout of the page
- It conveys the overall direction and description of the user interface
- Simplicity is the key

What NOT to include in a wireframe:

- Keep your colors to grayscale: white, black, and the grays in between.
- Use a maximum of two generic fonts, maybe one serif and one sans-serif.
- Avoid flashy graphics and images.
